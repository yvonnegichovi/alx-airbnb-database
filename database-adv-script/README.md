# Unleashing Advanced Querying Power

This project is a core component of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, aimed at equipping professional developers with advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques.

Through a series of hands-on tasks, learners will engage with a simulated Airbnb database to tackle real-world challenges related to query performance, complex data retrieval, indexing, and partitioning.

The ultimate goal is to build expertise in **database management** and **performance tuning**, crucial for developing scalable and efficient large-scale applications.

## About the Project

This module focuses on deepening SQL proficiency beyond the basics. Participants will:

* Write sophisticated queries
* Analyze and refactor them for optimal performance
* Apply advanced database features like indexing and table partitioning

The project emphasizes practical application by simulating real production-level scenarios where efficiency and scalability are non-negotiable.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

* **Master Advanced SQL**
  Craft complex SQL queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregation functions for in-depth data retrieval and analysis.

* **Optimize Query Performance**
  Utilize tools like `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` to identify bottlenecks and refactor SQL scripts for better performance.

* **Implement Indexing and Partitioning**
  Understand and apply indexing and table partitioning to enhance performance for large datasets.

* **Monitor and Refine Performance**
  Learn how to continuously monitor database health and implement schema and query refinements for peak efficiency.

* **Think Like a DBA**
  Develop a strategic mindset for database design and optimization to support high-volume, high-performance applications.

## Requirements

Before diving in, ensure you have:

* A strong foundation in SQL (e.g., `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, basic DDL/DML)
* Understanding of relational database concepts (primary keys, foreign keys, normalization, data types)
* Basic knowledge of performance monitoring tools (`EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`)
* Proficiency with Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
* Adherence to best practices in database design and SQL scripting

## Key Highlights (Task Overview)

This project is structured around several progressive tasks:

1. **Defining Relationships with ER Diagrams**
   Model entities, attributes, and relationships within the Airbnb schema.

2. **Complex Queries with Joins**
   Master `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables.

3. **Power of Subqueries**
   Use correlated and non-correlated subqueries for deeper data analysis.

4. **Aggregations and Window Functions**
   Utilize aggregation (`COUNT`, `SUM`) and window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`) for analytical insights.

5. **Indexing for Optimization**
   Identify bottlenecks and create indexes to boost query speed.

6. **Query Optimization Techniques**
   Analyze and refactor complex queries to enhance performance.

7. **Partitioning Large Tables**
   Implement table partitioning (e.g., on the Booking table) to manage large datasets efficiently.

8. **Performance Monitoring and Schema Refinement**
   Use tools like `SHOW PROFILE` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to monitor performance and refine schema.

## Task 0: Write Complex Queries with Joins

**Objective:**
Demonstrate mastery of SQL joins by writing advanced queries.

**Instructions Followed:**

* **INNER JOIN:**
  Retrieved all bookings with corresponding user details.

* **LEFT JOIN:**
  Retrieved all properties and their reviews, including properties without reviews (NULLs).

* **FULL OUTER JOIN (MySQL workaround):**
  Implemented using a combination of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` via `UNION ALL` to retrieve all users and bookings â€” even unmatched ones.

**Solution File:**
All queries for this task are located in:
`database-adv-script/joins_queries.sql`
